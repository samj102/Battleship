# Battleship

Welcome to the classic Battleship game, brought to your browser! This project aims to recreate the timeless Battleship experience using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You'll be diving into the depths of the ocean, strategizing against your opponent to sink their fleet while protecting your own.

Overview

In this project, you'll be developing a two-player version of Battleship, where one player will be you, and the other will be the computer (PC). Your task is to create an interactive gaming environment where players can place their ships, strategically aim their attacks, and ultimately, emerge victorious by sinking all enemy vessels.
